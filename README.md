# Pakistan Senate Sessions Attendance | Data Engineering Project


## Introduction 
In this data engineering project, we leverage Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda to create a scalable and efficient data processing pipeline. Amazon S3 serves as our primary storage solution, enabling us to securely store and manage vast amounts of data. AWS Lambda facilitates serverless computing, allowing us to execute code in response to events, such as data uploads, for real-time processing and transformation. The processed data is then ingested into Snowflake, our cloud-based data warehouse, where it can be seamlessly queried and analyzed. Finally, we utilize Tableau for dynamic data visualization, empowering stakeholders to explore insights and trends interactively.
